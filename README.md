Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my data science projects, each showcasing my skills in Python programming, data analysis, and more. Utilizing libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, I've created comprehensive analyses of my projects. These are comprehensive projects that integrate multiple skills to tackle complex problems with real-world data. 

Some of these projects include the following: 

Data Analysis and Visualization, hence projects involving the exploration of datasets to uncover insights and trends.    
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Initial data inspection and cleaning.    
Visualization that involves crafting informative and engaging charts and graphs using tools like Seaborn and Plotly.   
Statistical Analysis by applying statistical methods to understand data distributions and relationships.   
Data Cleaning by addressing missing values, outliers, and ensuring data integrity
